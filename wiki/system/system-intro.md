# What is a system?

You may feel that you have an “analytical” side, a “creative” side, a side that likes to party, and/or a side that likes technical work. For me, I have discovered those different sides of myself and have given them names, explored their personalities and backstories, and come up with symbols, species, and colors that have special meaning to me.

They're all different lenses in which I can view myself, and they help me think about how I react to things and how I can better cater to my own needs. If you've heard of [Parts Work](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/making-the-whole-beautiful/202202/how-parts-work-helps-us-get-know-ourselves) as a therapy technique, that's how I use these sides of myself.

To be blunt, I don't have DID (disassociative identity disorder), since that's when those parts are hugely split in a way that's detrimental to how someone lives their life—sometimes not sharing memories and causing other parts to feel like they've lost time, for example. Folks who consider themselves plural may have their parts present strongly in different situations called “fronting” and that doesn’t really happen for me either.

I’m putting all this up here just as a way for folks to get to know me better, and to have a place to explore more things about my parts as I discover more about them. If this causes you to explore your different sides and see where that goes, hopefully this helps you understand how things can be for you, too!
