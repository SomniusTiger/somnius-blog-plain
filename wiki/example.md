# Example Test Article: Header 1

Congratulations, you found this page! I use this for testing how the markdown on my website works. Enjoy the nonsense.

## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

Here is a paragraph with *emphasis*, **strong importance**, and a ~strikethrough~.

> A blockquote with a link: https://somni.us/ https://duckduckgo.com/

```
// A block of code

h4 { font-weight: bold; }
h5 { font-style: italic; }
h1 + h2, h1 + h3, h2 + h3 { margin-top: 0; }
h1 + h4 { margin-top: 2rem; }
```

Lists: 

* Unordered
* List
* Items

1. First
2. Second
3. Third

* [ ] Todo
* [x] Done

A table:

| a | b | c |
| - | - | - |
| first | second | third |
| first | second | third |
| first | second | third |

If this works, we should see this markdown content on the page just fine.
