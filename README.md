# A simple blog, using plain

This is the blog for Somnius, using [plain](https://github.com/cblgh/plain).

I'm putting these pages in source control so I have an easy way to track changes to my personal website, easily generate RSS feeds, and easily write and add posts.

To generate this website yourself, this requires a `golang` environment. Once you have `golang` installed and set up:
* First install plain via [the latest release](https://github.com/cblgh/plain/releases).
  * Download one of those releases, extract one of the compressed `.tar.gz` files, and install that by running `go install`.
* Then, run `plain`. You should see a generated `web` folder that contains all page contents.
