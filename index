bb <div class="main-img-container"><div class="main-img-inner-wrap"><img class="somnius-image" src="/assets/somnius_crop.jpeg" alt="A white tiger, with a glitchy right eye, reclines backwards on a kitchen counter. They’re holding a latte with leafy latte art drawn in the liquid in their paws, a music note appearing in a speech bubble next to their muzzle." /></div></div>
bb I’m a nonbinary, achromatic, polyamorous, sleepy robot tiger. Any pronouns are good to refer to me. I like indie & rhythm games, making espresso drinks, coding, hiking, high-quality audio, and lots more.
bb I taught myself how to code the front-end (HTML / CSS / JS) of websites for a living, and have a Bachelor's degree in UI/UX design.
bb This is my personal website—my online haven—where I share my thoughts, what I'm working on, and whatever else I like.
