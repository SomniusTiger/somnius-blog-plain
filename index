bb I'm a nonbinary, achromatic, polyamorous, sleepy robot tiger. I like indie & rhythm games, making espresso drinks, coding, hiking, high-quality audio, and lots more. Any pronouns are good to refer to me.
bb This is my personal website where I share my thoughts, what I'm working on, and whatever else I like.
